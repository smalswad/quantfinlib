## Overview
This repository contains a set of functions and classes used for my quantitative research projects over the years. It shall rather be seen as a library of useful functions, classes, etc., and repetitive applications rather than a complete research project. It includes functions for:

- Plotting (Scatter, correlation, lines, bars, clusters, ...)
- Portfolio construction (Factor models, portfolio allocations, ...) 
- Multiple hypothesis tests (fdp, k-fwer, ...)
- Optimization (Minimization problems, Black-Litterman, ...)
- Data loading (French's website, Open Asset Pricing, JKPFactors, ...)
- Option pricing (BSM model, Least-square Monte Carlo Primal + Dual, ...)
- Utilities (pd.DataFrames, np.arrays, lists, dicts, ...)
- others
